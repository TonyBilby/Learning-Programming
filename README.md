Learning-Programming
==============

This repository is for programming projects I created while trying to learn them. some may be broken, some may be ineffecient, some my just be stupid. I'm saving some here for my future self to look back and see my own immprovement. 

As of this update of the readme I've posted some Java, C#, C++ and some Python. I'll probably be adding some of my early PHP stuff a bit later.

###Disclaimer:
Everything I post here is most likely open source. It's for learning.. this was part of my learning process, if you're new to the programming world and like any of it go ahead and try it out. Please note however I am no responsable for anything any of my practice work does.. some of it can be a pretty resourse intensive on really old computer. When in doubt ctrl + c (in terminal to kill a never ending process)
